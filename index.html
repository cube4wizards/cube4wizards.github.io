        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
        <p>And like that, I should be hosted on a github page. Boy, do I hope that doesn't cost me anything. And, just to make sure I can, here's a <a href=http://www.google.com>link to Google</a>.</p>
        <p>Also, since we're here, I might as well list what else needs to be done to this website.</p>
        <h2>Todo</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Add content about myself. No point in having a site if my name isn't on it.</li>
            <li>Add css. I'm thinking a cleaned-up version from the tonio db site would make it look nice and crisp.</li>
            <li>Maybe add links to my personal repositories. I'm not sure I can link to active demos, but at least I can show people the code.</li>
            <li>Consider running the Jekyll blog for a bit. Could be an interesting exercise.</li>
            <li>Read the rest of the <a href=https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/>github pages documentation</a>. It's probably worth the read.</li>
        </ul>
